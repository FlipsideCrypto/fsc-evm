{% docs evm_aave_borrows_table_doc %}

Aave.ez_borrows contains transactions where users borrowed assets via the Aave protocol. In order to borrow assets, a user must first deposit their preferred asset and amount as collateral.  Borrowers can choose either a stable or variable borrow rate. For more information, see column descriptions. 


{% enddocs %}


{% docs evm_aave_deposits_table_doc %}

Aave.ez_deposits contains transactions where users deposited into the Aave protocol. A user deposits their preferred asset and amount. After depositing, users earn passive income based on the market borrowing demand. Additionally, depositing allows users to borrow by using their deposited assets as a collateral. Any interest earned by depositing funds helps offset the interest rate accumulated by borrowing.

{% enddocs %}


{% docs evm_aave_flashloans_table_doc %}

Aave.ez_flashloans contains flash loan transactions where a borrower executes an
undercollateralised, one-block liquidity loan. Flash loans are a feature designed for developers, due to the technical knowledge required to execute one. Flash Loans allow you to borrow any available amount of assets without providing any collateral, as long as the liquidity is returned to the protocol within one block transaction.  

{% enddocs %}


{% docs evm_aave_liquidations_table_doc %}

Aave.ez_liquidatons contains transactions in which a borrower's collateral asset is liquidated. Liquidations occur when a borrower's health factor goes below 1 due to their collateral value not properly covering their loan/debt value. This might happen when the collateral decreases in value or the borrowed debt increases in value against each other. This collateral vs loan value ratio is shown in the health factor. In a liquidation, up to 50% of a borrower's debt is repaid and that value + liquidation fee is taken from the collateral available, so after a liquidation the amount liquidated from one's debt is repaid. 

{% enddocs %}


{% docs evm_aave_market_stats_table_doc %}

Aave.ez_market_stats details market statistics for Aave markets by block hour.  These include reserves, token addresses, token prices, borrow and supply rates, the utilization rate, and total supplies of liquidity and debt tokens. For more information, see column descriptions.  

{% enddocs %}


{% docs evm_aave_proposals_table_doc %}

Aave.ez_proposals contains transactions in which Aave improvement proposals are submitted for governance voting.  AAVE and/or stkAAVE token holders receive governance powers. Proposal power gives access to creating and sustaining a proposal. 

{% enddocs %}


{% docs evm_aave_repayments_table_doc %}

Aave.ez_repayments contains transactions in which a borrower repays their loan (debt).  Loans are repaid in the same asset borrowed, plus accrued interest. Borrowers can also use their collateral to repay in version 2 of Aave Protocol. Borrowers can pay back their loan based on the USD price as they can borrow any of the available stable coins (USDC, DAI, USDT, etc.).

{% enddocs %}


{% docs evm_aave_votes_table_doc %}

Aave.ez_votes contains Aave governance voting transactions. AAVE and/or stkAAVE token holders receive governance powers proportionally to the sum of their balance. Voting power is used to vote for or against existing proposals.


{% enddocs %}


{% docs evm_aave_withdraws_table_doc %}

Aave.ez_withdraws contains transactions in which a user withdraws liquidity from the Aave protocol.  Users can use their â€œaTokens" as liquidity without withdrawing. They need to make sure there is enough liquidity (not borrowed) in order to withdraw, if this is not the case, users need to wait for more liquidity from depositors or borrowers repaying.

{% enddocs %}


{% docs evm_aave_borrow_rate_mode %}

The rate mode the user is swapping from. Stable: 1, Variable: 2.  Borrowers can switch between the stable and variable rate at any time. Stable rates act as a fixed rate in the short-term, but can be re-balanced in the long-term in response to changes in market conditions. The variable rate is the rate based on the offer and demand in Aave. The stable rate, as its name indicates, will remain pretty stable and its the best option to plan how much interest you will have to pay. The variable rate will change over time and could be the optimal rate depending on market conditions.
