## What

This table provides daily ERC20 token balance snapshots for verified token contracts by making direct `balanceOf` contract calls at the end of each day. It captures the current token balance for each address-token pair that has had transfer activity, providing a comprehensive view of token holdings across all verified ERC20 tokens with decimal adjustments and USD valuations where available. Historical ERC20 balances data available, starting from `2025-06-10`.

## Key Use Cases

- Daily portfolio tracking and balance monitoring for ERC20 tokens
- Historical balance analysis and trend identification
- Token holder distribution analysis at daily granularity
- Wallet balance snapshots for reporting and analytics
- Cross-token balance comparisons and concentration analysis
- Token supply distribution monitoring over time
- Daily balance-based yield and return calculations

## Important Relationships

- **Join with fact_blocks**: Use `block_number` for block metadata and timestamps
- **Join with dim_labels**: Use `address` for entity identification and categorization
- **Join with dim_contracts**: Use `contract_address` for token contract details
- **Join with ez_prices_hourly**: USD valuations already included but can be refreshed
- **Join with ez_balances_native_daily**: Compare with native token daily balances
- **Join with ez_token_transfers**: Compare daily balances with transfer activity

## Commonly-used Fields

- `address`: The account address holding the token balance
- `contract_address`: The ERC20 token contract address
- `symbol`: Token symbol (USDC, WETH, etc.)
- `balance`: Token balance at end of day, decimal adjusted to standard units
- `balance_usd`: USD value of the token balance at end of day
- `balance_raw`: Raw balance in smallest token unit (wei equivalent)
- `balance_precise`: Precise decimal-adjusted balance as string
- `decimals`: Number of decimal places for the token
- `block_date`: The date for which this balance snapshot was taken
